hello world?
My name is John I'm a 27 year old elementary school computer teacher who never chose education as a career. I feel like I've always just kind of ended up places but now I am choosing to take control of my life, learn to code and become a web developer. I'm excited for where this path will take me and for all the interesting things I'll learn along the way!
